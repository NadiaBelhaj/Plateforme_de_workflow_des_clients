# Customer workflow platform using Php and Symfony4

Graduation Project: Design and development of a customer workflow platform

Presented with a view to obtaining the Bachelor's degree in Electronic Commerce at the Higher School of Digital Economy of Manouba

Subject: As part of improving the process of tracking prospects and customers at TrustiT, we will opt for the creation of a web application to automate the current methods.

The platform will aim to facilitate the use of data and make automatic updates. So we will deal with the following two axes:

● The collection and processing of prospect data, which consists of managing the prospecting part through new functionalities as well as the continuous follow-up which helps to get in touch with these prospects while updating their progress.

● The management of customer requests and orders which consists in managing what will happen after the transformation of the prospect into a customer, the follow-up and the processing of the essential operations for these customers.
